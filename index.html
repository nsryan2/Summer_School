  <h2>Note from the creator:</h2>
  <p> From the Readme file of this repository, given as a notice to potential (notably discouraged) visitors to this site.</p>
  <p>
I intend this collection of documents to be for my edification and enjoyment, this is not a resource for students other than myself. The format, content, and maintenance are a product of my efforts and the resources provided to my classmates and me (as well as free applications available online or through the university). This project is not affiliated with any University effort or course assignment but is maintained for my sanity in these crazy summer times.
  </p>
  <p>
If you would like to replicate this resource for yourself, feel free. I will not be approving or checking any pull requests or issues opened by anyone other than myself. I intend for this measure to limit the possibility of any academic dishonesty that could arise. Similarly, this repository serves as a hub for my notes, ideas, and work and is not for other students in its final form. As such, upon completion of the course, I will change these documents (and the repository as a whole) to private mode so that no one can benefit from the work that I put into this course unfairly. I hope that these measures are sufficiently compliant with the student code (from what I've read of it they seem to be) so as not to raise any issues, but please alert me if this is not the case. 
  </p>
<p>
In summation, I am not looking for collaboration, assistance, copying, or any form of academic dishonesty with my involvement in this repository. I mean for this repository to manage the resources provided throughout the course, and my work for the course, and is distinctly not for the use of students to come. Although I welcome classmates to fork or clone this repository, I will not be allowing contributions or additions by other students to by version of this repository. I chose this format as an exercise in my limited coding skills, and as a way to practice with git and GitHub interfacing (i.e. for my edification). This format also provides the ability to open these documents on any device with the convenience of a URL, and the flexibility of a code I cobbled and built through open-source material and my efforts.
